## Getting Started:

1. First, clone the repository to your local machine and navigate into the folder. For example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/helium/mappers.git
cd mappers
```

2. Second, install all the dependencies:

* Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
* Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`

3. Edit your environment variables:

* Open the .sample.env file located at the root of the project
* Create a Mapbox account and copy your public access token
* Paste it in place of <replace me> for the PUBLIC_MAPBOX_KEY variable. That line should now look like this:

`PUBLIC_MAPBOX_KEY=pk.ey[...the rest of your access token...]`

Rename the file ".env" (delete ".sample" from the file name)

4. Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && yarn`

5. Start development server:
* Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

To Reset Database

  * Run `mix ecto.reset`
